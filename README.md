# Synonym-Resolution-with-Word-Embeddings-


Conducted in-depth experiments with word embeddings for automatic synonym resolution as part of COMP 472 coursework.
Evaluated the performance of the word2vec-google-news-300 pre-trained model against alternative pre-trained models.
Developed custom-trained models using word2vec to enhance synonym identification accuracy.
Implemented Python scripts for model training and synonym test automation, leveraging libraries like gensim.
Analyzed and compared the effectiveness of different embedding dimensions and training datasets.
Collaborated in a team setting to integrate individual components into a cohesive synonym resolution system.
Presented findings and demonstrated the synonym resolution tool in a comprehensive demo presentation.
